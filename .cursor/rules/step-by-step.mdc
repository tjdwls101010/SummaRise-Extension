## Phase 2: Implementation Planning
**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
Based on Phase 1 findings, create a detailed implementation roadmap.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
```markdown
## Implementation Plan

### Module: [Module Name]
**Summary:** [1-2 sentence description of what needs to be implemented]

**Tasks:**
- [ ] [Specific implementation task]
- [ ] [Specific implementation task]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Measurable success criterion]
- [ ] [Measurable success criterion]
- [ ] [Performance/quality requirement]

### Module: [Next Module Name]
[Repeat structure above]
```

---

## Phase 3: Implementation Execution
**REQUIRED ACTIONS:**
1. Implement each module following the plan from Phase 2
2. Verify ALL acceptance criteria are met before proceeding
3. Ensure code adheres to conventions identified in Phase 1

**QUALITY GATES:**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] Code follows established conventions
- [ ] Minimalistic approach maintained
- [ ] Expert-level implementation standards met

---

## Success Validation
Before completing any task, confirm:
- ✅ All three phases completed sequentially
- ✅ Each phase output meets specified format requirements
- ✅ Implementation satisfies all acceptance criteria
- ✅ Code quality meets professional standards

## Response Structure
Always structure your response as:
1. **Phase 1 Results**: [Codebase analysis findings]
2. **Phase 2 Plan**: [Implementation roadmap]  
3. **Phase 3 Implementation**: [Actual code with validation]
